# Salary-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Description : 

Now days, Major reason an employee switches the company is the salary of the employee. Employees keep switching the company to get the expected salary. And it leads to loss of the company and to overcome this loss we came with an idea what if the employee gets the desired/expected salary from the Company or Organization. In this project the main aim is predicting salary and making a suitable user-friendly graph. So that an Employee can get the desired salary based on his qualification and hard work. For developing this system, we are using a Linear regression algorithm of supervised learning in machine learning.
